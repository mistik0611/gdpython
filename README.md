# Python Geometry Dash Project
Hello, and welcome to my first GitHub repository!
I am currently trying to recreate a simple copy of the game "Geometry Dash" and I have decided to post the code here.
I am just a beginner in coding, so my code might not be very well organized and messy, and I would be happy if anyone would help me fix it!

Please note that I do not intend to fully recreate the game Geometry Dash, this project is only inspired from the actual game. If you're interested, please consider checking out [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) by [RobTop Games](https://www.robtopgames.com/) too!
