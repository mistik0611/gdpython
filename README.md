# Python Geometry Dash Project
Hello, and welcome to my first GitHub repository!
I am currently trying to recreate a simple copy of the game "Geometry Dash" and I have decided to post it here.
I am just a beginner in coding, so my code might not be very well organized and messy, and I would be happy if anyone would help me fix it!

## Current issues
~~Game is laggy, key press doesn't work instantly~~ Fixed on 2025/02/01
Pause menu code failed, in the file as comments
